## Deprecation

In order to simplify further development and use, this package has been renamed [`@qui-cli/log`](https://npmjs.com/package/@qui-cli/log).

Version numbering is continuous between the two packages: `@battis/qui-cli.log@4.0.0` marks the deprecation point for this package, and `@qui-cli/log@4.0.0` marks the initial release of that package. This package is a shim for that transition point, and will not receive further updates.
