# Example: README

Demonstrate using `@qui-cli/markdown` to generate a README

## Notes

- If documenting a command, rather than a plugin, import the plugin portion only to avoid running the command when generating documentation.
- Call `Positionals.requireNoMoreThan(0)` immediately before `Core.init()` to override any required positionals from the imported command.
